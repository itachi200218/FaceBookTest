 miniProject - Selenium Automation Framework

This project demonstrates a modular and maintainable Selenium automation framework using Java 21, TestNG, and Maven. It automates signup flows and UI interactions for a sample Facebook-like web application, using a Page Object Model (POM) design and TestNG lifecycle annotations for structured execution and reporting. The framework supports both Chrome and Edge browsers with parameterized configuration, and is optimized for parallel test runs, validation logic, and scalable integration.
